# Express.js - Inadequate Error Handling in User Retrieval Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling. The provided code retrieves user data using a route parameter, but only handles the scenario where the user is not found.  More comprehensive error handling is necessary for production readiness.

## Bug Description

The `/users/:id` route currently lacks error handling for database connection issues, data processing errors, or other unexpected exceptions.  This can lead to application crashes or the exposure of sensitive internal information to clients.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing more robust error handling mechanisms, including:

*   Catching potential exceptions during database operations using `try...catch` blocks.
*   Using a centralized error-handling middleware to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
*   Providing more informative error messages to the client without exposing internal details.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4.  Run `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the solution) to start the server.
5.  Test the API using tools like Postman or curl.
